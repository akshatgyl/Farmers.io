# Farmers.io

Centralization of the agricultural and farming scenario.

Helps farmers by providing them with easy to use application to manage their farming activities. They can lookup their field data, get notifications about upcoming bad weather, and geofencing utilizing their current location and location of the farm. In geofencing we notify the farmers when they have not visited the farm for a while (for demo purposes- 10 seconds). We display data on an iPhone and an Apple Watch.
